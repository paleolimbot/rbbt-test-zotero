ABSTRACT

ABSTRACT

Dunnington DW, Spooner IS, Krkošek WH, Gagnon GA, Cornett RJ, Kurek J, White CE, Misiuk B, Tymstra D. 2018. Anthropogenic activity in the Halifax region, Nova Scotia, Canada, as recorded by bulk geochemistry of lake sediments. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:334–348.

Separating the timing and effects of multiple watershed disturbances is critical to a comprehensive understanding of lakes, which is required to effectively manage lacustrine systems that may be experiencing adverse water quality changes. Advances in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology has led to the availability of high-resolution, high-quality bulk geochemical data for aquatic sediments, which in combination with carbon, nitrogen, δ 13 C, and δ 15 N have the potential to identify watershed-scale disturbance in lake sediment cores. We integrated documented anthropogenic disturbances and changes in bulk geochemical parameters at 8 lakes within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), Nova Scotia, Canada, 6 of which serve as drinking water sources. These data reflect more than 2 centuries of anthropogenic disturbance in the HRM that included deforestation, urbanization and related development, and water-level change. Deforestation activity was documented at Lake Major and Pockwock Lake by large increases in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (50–300%), and moderate increases in C/N (>10%). Urbanization was resolved at Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, and First Lake by increases in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (10–300%), decreases in C/N (>10%), and increases in δ 15 N (>2.0‰). These data broadly agree with previous paleolimnological bioproxy data, in some cases identifying disturbances that were not previously identified. Collectively these data suggest that bulk geochemical parameters and lake sediment archives are a useful method for lake managers to identify causal mechanisms for possible water quality changes resulting from watershed-scale disturbance.

Separating the timing and effects of multiple disturbances is critical to a comprehensive understanding of lakes, which is required to effectively manage these systems (Smol 2010 . . . Freshwater Biology. 55:–. doi:. , Ginn et al. 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ). Recently, advances in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology have led to the availability of high-resolution, high-quality bulk geochemical data for aquatic sediments, particularly for typically minerogenic elements such as titanium (Ti), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), zirconium (Zr), and calcium (Ca) (Croudace et al. 2006 , , . . . Geol Soc London Spec Publ. 267:–. doi:. , Dunnington et al. 2016 , , , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 56:–. doi:. , Rouillon and Taylor 2016 , . . Environ Pollut. 214:–. doi:. PMID:. ). XRF allows for rapid, nondestructive measurement of these elements at relatively low cost, allowing a large volume of paleolimnological data to be obtained (Boyle 2000 . . . J Paleolimnol. 23:–. doi:. , Rouillon and Taylor 2016 , . . Environ Pollut. 214:–. doi:. PMID:. ). Minerogenic elements are commonly used to reconstruct land-use change or anthropogenic disturbance (Walker et al. 1993 , , , . . . Quat Int. 20:–. doi:. , Dixit et al. 2000 , , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 16:–. doi:. , Brunschön et al. 2010 , , . . . Vegetation Hist Archaeobotany. 19:–. doi:. , Simonneau et al. 2013 , , , , , , , , , , et al. . . J Archaeolog Sci. 40:–. doi:. ), although few studies explicitly test the sensitivity of these elements as indicators of watershed disturbance using comparison to historical records.

Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), Table 1 and stable isotopes of C and N (δ 13 C and δ 15 N, respectively) can be used to infer changes in origin of sedimentary organic matter, changes in nutrient source, and changes in autochthonous productivity (Meyers and Teranes 2001 , . . . In: , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments: volume 2: physical and geochemical methods. Vol. 2. : . p. –. , Mayr et al. 2009 , , , , , , , , , , et al. . . J Paleolimnol. 42:–. doi:. ) and have the potential to enhance the sensitivity of bulk geochemical indicators when combined with minerogenic elemental geochemistry (Dunnington et al. 2016 , , , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 56:–. doi:. ). C, N, δ 13 C, and δ 15 N are also often compared with historical land-use change, primarily in connection with cultural eutrophication (Brenner et al. 1999 , , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 22:–. doi:. , Köster et al. 2005 , , , , , . . . Aquat Ecosyst Health Manage. 8:–. doi:. , Routh et al. 2009 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 42:–. doi:. ), however few studies use these parameters in combination with minerogenic elemental geochemistry to enhance the sensitivity of minerogenic parameters to land-use change or anthropogenic disturbance.

The Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), located on the southeast coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, has a long history of anthropogenic disturbance, including deforestation, land clearing, agriculture, urbanization, and water-level change. The HRM contains hundreds of lakes, many of which have been previously studied from a land use (Mandell 1994 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ), water quality (Ogden 1971 . . Water quality survey of selected metropolitan area lakes. : . , Anderson et al. 2017 , , , , . . . Environ Sci Technol. 51:–. doi:. PMID:. , Poltarowicz 2017 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ), or paleolimnological (Tropea et al. 2007 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 23:–. doi:. , Ginn et al. 2010 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 43:–. doi:. , Tymstra 2013 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . , Misiuk 2014 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . , Ginn et al. 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ) perspective. Lakes serve as the primary drinking water supply for residents of the HRM, and as a result, lake managers have identified long-term data as critical to managing these resources (Anderson et al. 2017 , , , , . . . Environ Sci Technol. 51:–. doi:. PMID:. ). Historical information about the HRM is readily accessible, and much has been documented with respect to historical land-use change in the region.

Increased quantity and resolution of long-term data are necessary for developing effective management strategies in the face of future changes (Smol 2010 . . . Freshwater Biology. 55:–. doi:. , Ginn et al. 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. , Anderson et al. 2017 , , , , . . . Environ Sci Technol. 51:–. doi:. PMID:. ). Using XRF to measure elemental composition of lake sediment in combination with C, N, and stable isotopes of C and N, has the potential to increase the quantity and resolution of paleolimnological analyses, provided these parameters are reliable indicators of watershed-scale disturbance. In this study, we use dated sediment cores from 8 lakes in the HRM to test the sensitivity of these indicators to historically documented watershed-scale disturbance, and document how these disturbances are recorded in the bulk geochemical record.
Study site

Eight lakes were selected from the HRM that encompassed a variety of land-use histories and watershed characteristics ( Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). Watershed area for study lakes ranged from <600 ha (Bennery Lake, First Lake, Second Lake, Lake Lemont, First Chain Lake; Table 1 ) to >5,000 ha (Lake Major, Pockwock Lake; Table 1 ). Lake Fletcher had a watershed area of approximately 16,000 ha, which also contained the watersheds of First and Second Lake. Some watersheds are now primarily forested (>90%: Bennery Lake, Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, Lake Lemont), whereas others now contain widespread residential and/or commercial development (First Lake, Second Lake, Lake Fletcher, First Chain Lake). Six lakes (Bennery Lake, Lake Lemont, First Chain Lake, Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, and Lake Fletcher) currently serve as primary or backup water supplies for Halifax Water, the utility responsible for water and wastewater services in the HRM. The lakes are all oligotrophic on the basis of total phosphorus measurements (Table S1; Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment 2004 Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. . Phosphorus: Canadian guidance framework for the management of freshwater systems. : . ), however some are mesotrophic on the basis of Secchi depth, possibly due to dissolved organic carbon in some of the lakes (Carlson and Simpson 1996 , . . A coordinator's guide to volunteer monitoring. : . ).

The study lakes were also selected such that previous work was available with which to compare our results. Ginn et al. ( 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ) performed a diatom-based paleoecological study of anthropogenic stressors on 51 lakes in the HRM and found that Pockwock Lake, First Chain Lake, and Lake Major were affected primarily by acidification; Lake Fletcher was affected primarily by nutrients; and First Lake, Second Lake, and Lake Lemont were affected primarily by climate. Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, and First Lake were additionally found to be affected by an increase in salinity due to road salt application (Ginn et al. 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ). Pockwock Lake has been studied in detail by Tropea et al. ( 2007 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 23:–. doi:. ), who found 2 distinct decreases (∼1940 and ∼1992) in diatom-inferred pH between the early 1800s and 2002, and Ginn et al. ( 2010 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 43:–. doi:. ), who found little change in chrysophyte assemblages over time. Tymstra ( 2013 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . ) and Misiuk ( 2014 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . ) evaluated the limnology and bulk geochemical paleolimnology of First Lake and Second Lake, respectively, the results of which are used in this study.

Mandell ( 1994 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ) evaluated water quality and land-use change in 34 lakes in the HRM after Ogden ( 1971 . . Water quality survey of selected metropolitan area lakes. : . ) and found that the primary stressor was road salt input at Second Lake, and regional acidic deposition was the primary stressor at Pockwock Lake. In general, HRM watershed hydrological regimes were often impacted by deforestation within a watershed, new stormwater input from increased watershed impervious surfaces often induced nutrient input leading to eutrophication, and residential lawn development likely increased P concentration in HRM lakes (Mandell 1994 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ). Poltarowicz ( 2017 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ) quantified phosphorus (P) dynamics at Lake Fletcher, finding that septic systems were likely a major contributor of P to the lake. Fraser ( 1986 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ) evaluated groundwater contributions to the Chain lakes system, and Anderson et al. ( 2017 , , , , . . . Environ Sci Technol. 51:–. doi:. PMID:. ) documented recent (since 1999) decreases in sulfate deposition resulting in increased pH and treatment challenges at Lake Major. Finally, Stantec Consulting Ltd. ( 2012 Stantec Consulting Ltd. . An analysis of the HRM lakes water quality monitoring program (2007-2011). : . ) evaluated the results of the HRM Lakes Water Quality Monitoring program, which measured water quality parameters over 5 yr at many HRM lakes, including Lake Fletcher, First Chain Lake, First Lake, and Second Lake.
Materials and methods
Historical methods

Watershed history is critical when evaluating the results of paleolimnological studies, as land-use data provide context for observed trends in geochemical parameters (Smol 1992 . . . J Aquat Ecosyst Health. 1:–. doi:. , Swetnam et al. 1999 , , . . . Ecol Appl. 9:–. doi:. , Garrison and Wakeman 2000 , . . . J Paleolimnol. 24:–. doi:. ). To obtain historical land-use information, aerial photographs between 1964 and 2013 were georeferenced and evaluated for potential watershed disturbances. Aerial photographs were available approximately once per decade for study lakes and were obtained from the Nova Scotia GeoNOVA Aerial Photography Collection (Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources 2017 Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources. . . ). Early watershed history was researched by reviewing resources on early deforestation and canal-building in Nova Scotia such as those contributed by Bouchette ( 1831 . . The British dominions in North America. : . ), Johnson ( 1986 . . Forests of Nova Scotia. : . ), and Burrows ( 2003 . . Nova Scotia through the trees 1761–1930. : . ). Additionally, the Nova Scotia Institute of Science archive and the Local History collection at the Halifax Regional Library were reviewed for early material on Halifax area lakes.

Historical periods of disturbance are described in detail in the text, but summarized using the abbreviations Deforestation, Water Works, Agriculture, and Urbanization. Deforestation is used when it is suspected that the land was cleared or logging was active in the watershed. Water Works is used to denote the construction of treatment facilities, which in some cases also involved water level change (e.g., Lake Major, Pockwock Lake). Agriculture is used where there are specific references to a farm in the literature. Finally, Urbanization is used when widespread residential, commercial, and/or industrial development occurred in the watershed.
Coring and sampling

Sediment gravity cores were collected using a Glew gravity coring device (Glew 1989 . . . J Paleolimnol. 2:–. doi:. , Glew et al. 2001 , , . . . In: , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments. : . p. –. ) from Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, Bennery Lake, First Chain Lake, Lake Fletcher, and Lake Lemont during 2015 and 2016 ( Table 1 ). Cores from these lakes were extruded using a Glew portable extruder (Glew 1988 . . . J Paleolimnol. 1:–. doi:. , Glew et al. 2001 , , . . . In: , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments. : . p. –. ) at 0.5 cm intervals for the top 10.0 cm and at 1.0 cm intervals thereafter except the core from Bennery Lake, where samples were extruded at 0.5 cm for the top 5.0 cm and 1.0 cm intervals thereafter. The core from Second Lake was collected in 2013 (Misiuk 2014 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . ); the core from First Lake was collected in 2012 (Tymstra 2013 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . ). These cores were split and volumetrically subsampled at 1.0 cm intervals. Cores were collected from the deepest basin of each lake except for the core from Lake Major, where the core was collected from the southernmost basin at a depth of 26 m due to field constraints (Table S1). All sediment samples were dried at 60 C for 48 h and ground using a mortar and pestle prior to geochemical measures.
Bulk sediment geochemistry

For this study, we used sedimentary concentrations of Ti, Zr, K, Rb, and Ca, which are elements whose concentrations are both well-characterized by XRF and have been used in the past to characterize land-use change, particularly erosion (Mackereth 1966 . . . Philos Trans R Soc London, Ser B. 250:–. doi:. , Engstrom and Wright 1984 , . . . In: , , , editors. Lake sediments and environmental history: studies in palaeolimnology and palaeoecology in honour of Winifred Tutin. : . p. –. , Garrison and Wakeman 2000 , . . . J Paleolimnol. 24:–. doi:. , Simonneau et al. 2013 , , , , , , , , , , et al. . . J Archaeolog Sci. 40:–. doi:. , Rouillon and Taylor 2016 , . . Environ Pollut. 214:–. doi:. PMID:. ). Elemental geochemistry was measured in the laboratory using portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF). X-ray fluorescence has long been used to measure elemental geochemistry in lake sediments (Boyle 2000 . . . J Paleolimnol. 23:–. doi:. ) and more recently, investigators have reported replicable results from field-portable XRF models for use in aquatic sediments measuring elemental geochemistry of algae (Bull et al. 2017 , , . . . Environ Pollut. 220:–. doi:. PMID:. ), contaminated soils (Rouillon and Taylor 2016 , . . Environ Pollut. 214:–. doi:. PMID:. ), bedrock (White et al. 2014 , , . . . In: , , editors. Geoscience and mines branch report ME 2014-001: report of activities 2013. : . p. –. , Tarr and White 2016 , . . . In: Geoscience and Mines Branch Report ME 2016-001: Report of Activities 2015. : . p. –. ), wetland sediments (Loder et al. 2017 , , , , , . . Wetlands Ecol Manage. –. doi: ), and in paleolimnological studies (Dunnington et al. 2016 , , , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 56:–. doi:. , 2017 , , , , , , . . . FACETS. 2:–. doi:. ). Elemental concentrations recorded by the pXRF instrument were in parts per million (ppm) according to a factory calibration. Replicates indicated that our data were precise, but because the factory calibration was not matrix-specific to lake sediments, it is challenging to compare absolute concentration values from this study to non-pXRF studies (Hunt and Speakman 2015 , . . . J Archaeolog Sci. 53:–. doi:. ).

Sediment samples for C, N, and stable isotopes of C and N (δ 13 C and δ 15 N, respectively) were sent to the Stable Isotopes in Nature Laboratory (SINLAB) at the University of New Brunswick. These parameters represent both the organic and inorganic components of the sample. Isotopic composition of carbon (δ 13 C) was measured relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB), and isotopic composition of nitrogen (δ 15 N) was measured relative to the atmospheric value. C/N ratios were calculated as mass ratios.

For pXRF analyses, every fifth sample throughout each core was analyzed in triplicate to quantify uncertainty. In addition to standard SINLAB QA/QC protocols for organic analyses, 20 samples were run in duplicate to quantify uncertainty for organic matter parameters. Median relative standard error (RSE) values were less than 4% for all study parameters. Because some individual error values were high (>10%), error bars were included in relevant visualizations. Error bars, when large enough to be visible, represent ± 1 standard error.

The magnitude of changes in geochemical parameters is reported in this study as ( new value − old value ) / old value , expressed as a percent. Changes in δ 13 C and δ 15 N are reported as ( new value − old value ) expressed in permille (‰), because these values are not zero-based.
Age-depth models

210 Pb activity was estimated using a 210 Po assay measured by alpha spectroscopy at the André E. Lalonde AMS laboratory at the University of Ottawa. Dating uncertainties were propagated in quadrature based on measurement uncertainties in weighing, radiochemical extraction, and radionuclide counting. Ages and sedimentation rates were calculated according to the constant rate of supply (CRS) model (Appleby and Oldfield 1983 , . . . Hydrobiologia. 103:–. doi:. ). Supported 210 Pb activity was estimated using the background 210 Pb, propagating the standard deviation of the background 210 Pb activity through further calculations in quadrature. Ages for depths prior to the 210 Pb background were extrapolated based on the average sedimentation rate of 210 Pb-dated depths and were interpreted with caution. Mass accumulation rates (MAR) were calculated using the CRS model and bulk density, which was calculated by weighing the total dry mass of each extruded slice divided by its volume, except for cores FLK12-1 and SLK13-1, for which bulk density was calculated by dividing the dry mass of the volumetric subsample by its volume.

No 210 Pb data were available for core FLK12-1 (First Lake), whose chronology was constrained by the point where total elemental Pb concentrations rise above background matched to the core from Second Lake (∼1895), the peak of the total elemental Pb concentration matched to the core from Second Lake (∼1958), and the time at which the core was collected (2012; Fig. S1). First Lake is adjacent to Second Lake ( Fig. 1 ), and it is unlikely that the base and peak of the total Pb concentration profile occurred at different times in the sediment profile. Using anthropogenic Pb deposition as an isochronous marker is not precise (Norton et al. 1992 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 7:–. doi:. , Blais et al. 1995 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 13:–. doi:. ), but was adequate to constrain the chronology for core FLK12-1. Total elemental Pb concentrations for First Lake and Second Lake are provided in the Supplement.
Numerical analyses

Variation in bulk geochemical parameters was summarized using principal components analysis (PCA). PCA is commonly used in paleolimnological studies to summarize a large number of variables (Legendre and Birks 2012 , . . . Pp. 201–248. In: , , , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments: volume 5: data handling and numerical techniques. Vol. 5. : . ). Variables were scaled to a variance of 1 (grouped by core) prior to the PCA. Both pXRF and organic analyses were performed on most samples. Samples where all values were not available were removed prior to the PCA. For comparability purposes, the sign of the first principal component was adjusted such that Ti was positively loaded onto the first component. Calculations were performed using R statistical software (R Core Team 2017 R Core Team. . R: a language and environment for statistical computing. : . ); raw data are included in the supplement in MUData format (Dunnington 2018 . . . R package version 1.0.1. , Dunnington and Spooner 2018 , . . . FACETS. 3:–. doi:. ).
Results
Historical observations

The earliest disturbance on HRM lakes was likely deforestation and land clearing by European settlers. The HRM was settled by the British in the mid-1700s, which likely marked the start of systematic land clearing in the area (Davis and Browne 1996 , , editors. . Natural history of Nova Scotia. : . ). This early clearing likely would not have affected lakes other than Lake Lemont and First Chain Lake, which are located closest to the population centers of Dartmouth and Halifax, respectively. First Chain Lake was adopted as the city water source for Halifax in 1848, when a canal was constructed between Long Lake (to the southwest) and the Chain lakes for the purposes of increasing the potential drinking water supply of the lakes (Johnston 1908 . . . Proc Trans N S Inst Sci. 12:–. ). Several mills used flow from the Chain lakes for power, several farms existed along St. Margret's Bay Road to the south of the lake, and granite quarries were located close to the canal (Fairibault 1908 . . . ). As early as 1905, “pollution” in the watershed was identified as a potential problem (Halifax Water Commission 1995 Halifax Water Commission. . Downstream: an historical reflection of the Halifax water supply system. : . ). Lake Lemont was adopted as the water supply for Dartmouth in 1891, was the site of a mill as early as the late 1700s, and was the site of a farm and gristmill at the time it was purchased by the Dartmouth Town Council in 1878 (Martin 1957 . . The story of Dartmouth. : . ).

In the early 1800s, deforestation was rapidly occurring in the Halifax area, such that in 1838 it was declared that forestry would soon be finished in the province (Creighton 1988 . . Forestkeeping: a history of the lands and forests of Nova Scotia 1926–1969. : . ). Lakes and streams provided efficient methods for transporting lumber prior to widespread railway and road construction (Davis and Browne 1996 , , editors. . Natural history of Nova Scotia. : . ). The forest composition near Lake Major is mentioned specifically on an 1831 map by Bouchette ( 1831 . . The British dominions in North America. : . ), at least 1 mill was located at the outlet of Pockwock Lake in 1823 (Bezanson 1993 . . Hammonds plains: the first 100 years. : . ), and Lake Fletcher was a part of the Shubanacadie Canal route, initially constructed in the mid-1800s (Bouchette 1831 . . The British dominions in North America. : . ). It is likely that these shorelines were logged at some point during the mid-1800s due to ease of transportation to market. Several other mills existed on Pockwock Lake prior to 1970, with the height of productivity between 1880 and 1940 (Bezanson 1993 . . Hammonds plains: the first 100 years. : . ).

Construction of railways in the late-1800s likely expanded the areas that were logged; according to Dr. B.E. Fernow's forest survey in 1909 and 1910, half of the province was estimated to be cleared (Burrows 2003 . . Nova Scotia through the trees 1761–1930. : . ). The construction of the railways adjacent to First Chain Lake (Canadian National) and Second Lake (Windsor & Annapolis Railway) likely resulted in more rapid clearing in these areas (Smiley 1971 . . Historical recordings of Beaver Bank 1798–1968 Halifax County Nova Scotia. : . ), and to some extent the watersheds of First Lake and Bennery Lake, which did not contain a railway but were situated close to well-established rail lines. With construction of roads and the advent of the pulp and paper industry, further clearing of study lake watersheds was likely during the first half of the 20th century (Burrows 2003 . . Nova Scotia through the trees 1761–1930. : . ).

Based on aerial photography available starting in 1964, widespread construction of roads, residential development, and construction of water treatment works were the primary disturbances in study lake watersheds (Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources 2017 Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources. . . ). The Lake Lemont area was already well developed by 1964, although little development was undertaken within the watershed itself except for the road at the south end of the lake, from which stormwater was routed out of the watershed following upgrades in the 1980s and 1990s. The complete Lake Fletcher watershed includes a very large area (16,000 ha) that was also well developed by 1964, although residential development in the immediate watershed also occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, a wastewater treatment plant commenced operation, discharging treated wastewater to the inlet of Lake Fletcher. In 2011, a smaller plant started discharging treated wastewater near the outlet of the lake.

In the First Lake watershed, Mandell ( 1994 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ) reported a 42% increase in urban land use between 1967 and 1986, compared to a 26% increase in urban land use at the adjacent Second Lake, although development at Second Lake only occurred at the outer reaches of its watershed. Construction of the 103 highway and St. Margret's Bay Road occurred prior to 1969 in the Chain lakes watershed, followed by the construction of the Ragged Lake Business Park in the late 1990s. Significant acid rock drainage (ARD) occurred in the Chain lakes watershed because of road and rail construction, commercial development, and infrastructure upgrades (Tarr and White 2016 , . . . In: Geoscience and Mines Branch Report ME 2016-001: Report of Activities 2015. : . p. –. ). Aerial photography indicated the Bennery Lake watershed appears to have undergone the least disturbance, with air photos indicating the construction of a power line across the lake to service the Halifax Airport in the 1960s, and minor logging and peripheral residential development in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Treatment works at Pockwock Lake were constructed starting in 1977, treatment works on Lake Major were constructed starting in 1999, and treatment works at Bennery Lake were constructed in the 1980s with some infrastructure upgrades in the early 2000s. Treatment works on Pockwock Lake and Lake Major were accompanied by dam construction and water-level increase, although a dam existed at Pockwock Lake at least as early as 1966 (Canadian-British Engineering Consultants 1966 Canadian-British Engineering Consultants. . Report on use of Lake Major for the greater Halifax area. : . ). The 101 highway was constructed and some residential development occurred within the Pockwock Lake watershed in the 1970s and 1980s, and by 1992 twinning of the 101 highway was complete. Localized deforestation has been present in the watershed from the 1970s to present (Steenberg et al. 2013 , , . . . Ann For Sci. 70:–. doi:. ). Hurricane Juan (2003) also caused a large amount of destruction in some areas of the Lake Major watershed, and presently small amounts of timber are harvested from the watershed (Steenberg et al. 2013 , , . . . Ann For Sci. 70:–. doi:. ).
Age–depth models

Halifax area lake sediments contained enough 210 Pb activity to assign dates with low uncertainty from ∼1900 to present for most lakes (s.d. <15 yr at 1900: Bennery Lake, Second Lake, and First Chain Lake), and from ∼1925 for all lakes ( Fig. 2 ). All lakes exhibit an exponential decline in 210 Pb activity with increasing core depth. Stable backgrounds of 210 Pb activity are generally recognized between ∼15 cm and 20 cm at each lake. Approximate basal ages for cores ranged from ∼1650 (First Chain Lake) to ∼1780 (Lake Fletcher). Mean MAR ranged from 102 g/m 2 /yr (First Chain Lake) to 156 g/m 2 /yr (Lake Major and Lake Fletcher), except at Second Lake, where the mean sediment accumulation rate was 551 g/m 2 /yr. The deepest basin at Second Lake was closer to an inlet stream than the deep basins of other lakes, which is likely responsible for the higher MAR at this site.

Numerical analyses

PCA summarized 79–95% of the variability of bulk geochemical parameters in the first 2 principal components (PC1 and PC2; Fig. 3 , Fig. S2). PC1 captured 53–77% of the total variation. Ti was loaded positively on the PC1 axis by definition. K, Rb, and Zr were all positively loaded on the PC1 axis for all lakes, whereas C was negatively loaded on the PC1 axis for all lakes. At Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, and Bennery Lake, δ 15 N was aligned with C on PC1; at Second Lake, Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, First Lake, and Second Lake, δ 15 N was aligned with Ti on PC1. C/N ratios were generally aligned with C on PC1 except at Lake Major and Pockwock Lake. The loadings of δ 13 C and Ca were generally small and were inconsistent between lakes. PC1 scores were interpreted as the combined response of the suite of proxies used in this study.

Bulk sediment geochemistry

Deforestation and related activity were the primary disturbances in the catchments of Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, Bennery Lake, and Second Lake; however, these disturbances only appeared to be clearly resolved in Lake Major and Pockwock Lake ( Fig. 3 ). Early deforestation on Pockwock Lake may have been recorded as an increase in Ti and Ca ∼1850; however, the age uncertainty at this depth and stability of other parameters make it difficult to confirm that early deforestation at Pockwock Lake was clearly resolved in the bulk geochemical record. Later (∼1880–1940), more intense mill and deforestation activity on Pockwock Lake occurred, resulting in more frequent use of the lake for transporting timber, in addition to deforestation surrounding the lake (Bezanson 1993 . . Hammonds plains: the first 100 years. : . , D. Haverstock, 13 September 2013, pers. comm.). During this period, C concentrations decreased by 18%, C/N ratios increased by 11%, and minerogenic element concentrations increased (Ti: 110%, Zr: 221%, K: 166%, Rb: 69%). δ 13 C values decreased slightly from −27.4‰ to −27.8‰, and δ 15 N increased slightly from 1.9‰ to 2.2‰. During the period of initial deforestation in the Lake Major catchment (1830–1860), responses were similar to those at Pockwock Lake but smaller in magnitude for minerogenic elements (Ti: +86%, Zr: +115%, K: +110%, Rb: +44%). Increases in C/N values for Lake Major during this period were larger than for Pockwock Lake (+26%), but other organic parameters (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, C) had opposite trends than those observed at Pockwock Lake. Bulk geochemical changes at the time of estimated deforestation were more subtle for other lakes, where parameter values at this time generally show no consistent pattern. PC1 scores deviated from background values following initial clearing at all study lakes, which likely reflects a combination of anthropogenic disturbances that followed initial clearing of the watershed.

Urbanization was the primary disturbance in the catchments of Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, First Lake, and First Chain Lake ( Fig. 4 ), in addition to several post-1950s disturbances on Bennery Lake and Second Lake ( Fig. 3 ). At Bennery Lake, airport construction that resulted in a powerline constructed across the north tip of the lake in the 1960s resulted in a disturbance that was identified by an increase in Rb at this age. Most parameters at Bennery Lake appeared to have a common trend between 1900 and present (C/N: −11%, δ 13 C: −1.21‰, δ 15 N: −0.33‰, Ti: +47%, Zr: +44%, K: +51%, Rb: +42%). At Second Lake, the primary disturbance following initial clearing occurred at ∼1930, after which C concentrations, C/N ratios, and δ 13 C values decreased (C: −25%, C/N: −9%, δ 13 C: −1.01‰); and δ 15 N, Ti, Zr, K, and Rb values increased (δ 15 N: +0.11‰, Ti: +14%, Zr: +22%, K: +25%, Rb: +33%). Mandell ( 1994 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ) noted that a culvert carrying road runoff entered Second Lake, and it is possible that even though residential development occurred after its installation, initial road construction was better recorded in the bulk geochemical record. Construction of the Windsor & Annapolis Railway in the late 1800s appears to mark the beginning of changes in Ti, Zr, and Rb at Second Lake.

At Lake Fletcher, 2 periods of urbanization were inferred from the historical record: large-scale urbanization in the upper watershed of the lake (1929–1970) and residential development in the immediate watershed of the lake (1980–2000; Fig. 4 ). The onset of urbanization and the end of residential development are resolved reasonably well at Lake Fletcher, the cumulative effect of which appeared to be a decrease in C concentrations and C/N ratios (C: −49%, C/N: −11%), and an increase in δ 13 C, δ 15 N, Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (δ 13 C: +0.49‰, δ 15 N: +2.48‰, Ti: +78%, Zr: +66%, K: +115%, Rb: +78%). Effects on Lake Fletcher in the mid-1800s due to the construction of the Shubenacadie Canal or deforestation appeared to be minimal. The Lake Lemont watershed adjoins the upper watershed of Lake Fletcher and was also subject to disturbance in the 1800s (e.g., clearing, agriculture, and water works construction). Most urbanization took place outside the Lake Lemont watershed, although a major road was constructed directly adjacent to the lake during this time. Cumulative early disturbance at Lake Lemont resulted in a decrease in C (−49%) and an increase in δ 13 C, δ 15 N, Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (δ 13 C: +0.73‰, δ 15 N: +1.68‰, Ti: +138%, Zr: +191%, K: +215%, Rb: +112%). Urbanization in the area resulted in further decrease in C concentrations (−17%) and a further increase in δ 15 N, Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (δ 15 N: +2.22‰, Ti: +10%, Zr: +4%, K: +17%, Rb: +11%). Peak δ 13 C values at Lake Lemont did not occur until ∼1990 (peak: −28.00‰).

Urbanization in the watershed of First Lake was intense (Mandell 1994 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . , Tymstra 2013 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . , Misiuk 2014 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . ), the onset of which was likely well resolved based on age–depth estimates from stable anthropogenic Pb deposition. From ∼1950 to ∼2000, C concentrations, C/N ratios, δ 13 C values, Zr concentrations, and Rb concentrations decreased (C: −10%, C/N: −6%, δ 13 C: −0.21‰, Zr: −12%, Rb: −57%), whereas δ 15 N values, Ti concentrations, and K concentrations increased (δ 15 N: +0.66‰, Ti: +18%, K: 24%). At First Chain Lake, geochemical parameters identified 2 disturbances, likely corresponding to highway construction in the watershed and the construction of the Bayer's Lake industrial park. Between 1920 and 1970, minerogenic element concentrations increased (Ti: +193%, Zr: +327%, K: +302%, Rb: +230%), after which these elements decreased in concentration (Ti: −51%, Zr: −61%, Rb: −51%). C/N ratios and Ca concentrations increased (C/N: +21%, Ca: +77%) and decreased (C/N: −27%, Ca: −56%), but peaked ∼1990 instead of ∼1970. δ 13 C values were increasing from 1970 to the top of the core. Urbanization at First Chain Lake led to widespread bedrock disturbance, which in turn led to acid rock drainage due to the chemical composition of the bedrock (Fraser 1986 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . , White et al. 2014 , , . . . In: , , editors. Geoscience and mines branch report ME 2014-001: report of activities 2013. : . p. –. , Tarr and White 2016 , . . . In: Geoscience and Mines Branch Report ME 2016-001: Report of Activities 2015. : . p. –. ), which likely dominated how urbanization was recorded in the geochemical record.

At Lake Major, a period of anomalous values was identified ∼1984–1995. Historical results suggested 2 recent disturbances: water-level rise coincident with water works construction ∼1999, and Hurricane Juan, which damaged a large amount of forest in the Lake Major watershed. It seems more likely that the anomalous values in this zone are related to one of these two events rather than neither event being recorded in the core as suggested by 210 Pb dates, and thus it is likely that the age was estimated incorrectly due to the influx of material caused by the event. The sediment is primarily organic, high C/N material, likely of soil or woody composition. We would expect this type of material to enter the lake either by Hurricane Juan or water level rise. Anomalous values return to pre-disturbance levels following the event. At Pockwock Lake, a disturbance is apparent ∼1976, after which time C increased to concentrations slightly greater than prior to 1880 (20%), and Ti, Zr, K, and Rb decreased to concentrations similar to those prior to 1880 (Ti: 0.20%, Zr: 21 ppm, K: 0.51%, Rb: 19 ppm). δ 13 C and δ 15 N values were both decreasing prior to water level change, and continued to decrease to present.
Discussion
Watershed disturbances

The impact of land clearing and deforestation was evident on some but not all study lakes despite some evidence of disturbances occurring in all watersheds. Changes were best resolved at Lake Major and Pockwock Lake, and were recorded in the bulk geochemical sediment record as increases in C/N ratios, Ti, Zr, K, and Rb concentrations, and decreases in C concentrations. Stable isotopes δ 13 C and δ 15 N did not show a strong trend following deforestation activity at either Lake Major or Pockwock Lake but decreased throughout the period of presumed anthropogenic influence. However, the earliest deforestation activity at Pockwock Lake was not well reflected in the bulk geochemical record, as were other early deforestation activities at other study lakes. At Pockwock Lake, an increase in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (50–300%) suggests increased erosion in the watershed associated with clearing (Engstrom and Wright 1984 , . . . In: , , , editors. Lake sediments and environmental history: studies in palaeolimnology and palaeoecology in honour of Winifred Tutin. : . p. –. , Garrison and Wakeman 2000 , . . . J Paleolimnol. 24:–. doi:. ), a decrease in C concentration suggests that clastic input is dominating sedimentation more than any productivity increase associated with soil erosion (Engstrom and Wright 1984 , . . . In: , , , editors. Lake sediments and environmental history: studies in palaeolimnology and palaeoecology in honour of Winifred Tutin. : . p. –. ), and an increase in C/N ratio indicates organic matter deposition included more terrestrial carbon as compared to autochthonous carbon (Meyers and Teranes 2001 , . . . In: , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments: volume 2: physical and geochemical methods. Vol. 2. : . p. –. ). Loadings of C/N and C were aligned on PC1 at these lakes, suggesting that in general, periods of higher C were also periods with a more terrestrial sedimentary organic matter signature (Meyers and Teranes 2001 , . . . In: , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments: volume 2: physical and geochemical methods. Vol. 2. : . p. –. ). Previous studies using bioproxies and bulk geochemistry have found that long-term effects from deforestation are small or are not easily resolved in lake sediments (Paterson et al. 1998 , , , , . . . Can J For Res. 28:–. doi:. , Laird et al. 2001 , , . . . Can J Fish AquatSci. 58:–. doi:. , Tremblay et al. 2010 , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 44:–. doi:. ), which is consistent with the results of this study.

The period of urbanization as resolved in study lakes was also associated with increases in clastic indicators (Ti, Zr, K, and Rb; 10–300%) and a decrease in C concentration; however, unlike the response to deforestation, the C/N ratios decreased during the period of urbanization in all lakes except First Chain Lake. This effect has also been observed in other studies of urbanized watersheds (Rosenmeier et al. 2004 , , , , . . . Hydrobiologia. 511:–. doi:. , Dunnington et al. 2016 , , , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 56:–. doi:. ). Loadings of C/N and C were not aligned on PC1 at most of these lakes, suggesting that periods of higher C were also periods with a more autochthonous sedimentary organic matter signature. Residents on First Lake and Lake Fletcher have observed deteriorating water quality in the form of algal blooms and decreased clarity (Tymstra 2013 . . . [honour's thesis]. []: . , Poltarowicz 2017 . . . [master's thesis]. []: . ). These lakes show a high magnitude of decrease in C/N ratios (>10%) and a high magnitude of increase in δ 15 N (>2.0‰). At Lake Lemont, δ 15 N values also increased by >2.0‰ during the period of urbanization but decreases in C/N ratios were <10%. These data suggest that lower C/N ratios were associated with increased productivity during the period of urbanization, likely in response to increased nutrient input as suggested by increases in δ 15 N. Increasing δ 15 N has been observed in response to urbanization or increasing population density in a number of studies (Rosenmeier et al. 2004 , , , , . . . Hydrobiologia. 511:–. doi:. , Köster et al. 2005 , , , , , . . . Aquat Ecosyst Health Manage. 8:–. doi:. , O'Reilly et al. 2005 , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 34:–. doi:. , Dunnington et al. 2016 , , , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 56:–. doi:. ), and has been linked to wastewater treatment processes (Leavitt et al. 2006 , , , . . . Limnol Oceanogr. 51:–. doi:. ) and increased external nitrate input (Teranes and Bernasconi 2000 , . . . Limnol Oceanogr. 45:–. doi:. ).

Urbanization at First Chain Lake was not associated with increased δ 15 N values or a decrease in C/N ratios to the same extent as First Lake and Lake Fletcher, although δ 15 N did increase slightly during this period. The Chain lakes watershed contains bedrock from the Cunard Formation of the Halifax Group (White 2010a . . . Atlantic Geology. 46:–. doi:. ), which has a high sulphur content (White 2010b . . Compilation of geochemical and petrographic data from the western and southern parts of the Goldenville and Halifax groups, Nova Scotia. : . , White and Barr 2010 , . . . In: , , , , editors. Geological society of America Memoirs. Vol. 206. : . p. –. ) and hence a high acid-generating potential (White et al. 2014 , , . . . In: , , editors. Geoscience and mines branch report ME 2014-001: report of activities 2013. : . p. –. , Tarr and White 2016 , . . . In: Geoscience and Mines Branch Report ME 2016-001: Report of Activities 2015. : . p. –. ). Thus, the effect of development had a markedly different impact on conditions at First Chain Lake than other lakes with urbanized watersheds. During the period of watershed disturbance there was an increase in C/N ratios and in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb concentrations. First Chain Lake has traditionally had low water column productivity, likely a result of acidic water column conditions.

Recovery from urbanization or a stabilization of conditions based on bulk geochemical parameter values was observed at lakes with urbanized watersheds following the end of construction (i.e., the end of physical disturbance to the watershed). This effect has also been noted in the literature (Garrison and Wakeman 2000 , . . . J Paleolimnol. 24:–. doi:. ). In particular, δ 15 N values at Lake Lemont and First Chain Lake returned to pre-urbanization values following watershed disturbance. δ 15 N values in First Lake and Fletcher Lake did not return to pre-urbanization values and continue to increase despite recent stabilization of C/N and clastic indicator elements. This suggests that even though watershed stability increased following the end of new construction, nutrient input may still be occurring in these systems.

Previous paleolimnological studies using minerogenic elemental geochemistry as indicators of urbanization broadly agree with the trend and magnitude of parameters reported in this study. Christopher ( 1999 . . . [dissertation]. []: . ) observed increases in elemental K concentrations following land clearing, agricultural activity, and urbanization at an urban lake in St. John's, Newfoundland, for which the magnitude of increase was on the order of +100% during combined land clearing and agricultural activity, and +50% during urbanization. Pienitz et al. ( 2006 , , . . . Can J Bot. 84:–. doi:. ) observed the opposite trend at an urban lake in Québec City, Québec: during industrialization and urbanization, elemental C concentrations increased while Al concentrations decreased. It is likely this trend can be attributed to increases in productivity at a magnitude that was not observed in Halifax-area lakes. Rosenmeier et al. ( 2004 , , , , . . . Hydrobiologia. 511:–. doi:. ) observed a decrease in C/N ratios of about 15% following urbanization at an urban lake in Guatemala, and a δ 15 N increase of about 1.5‰ during the same period. Leavitt et al. ( 2006 , , , . . . Limnol Oceanogr. 51:–. doi:. ) reported a 2–5‰ increase in δ 15 N values because of treated sewage input to several Canadian prairie lakes.

Construction of water treatment facilities occurred on Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, Bennery Lake, Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, and First Chain Lake. In all cases this involved construction of an intake structure, and in other cases involved pipelines/canals to increase the hydrologic throughput of the system (First Chain Lake) or dam construction leading to water level increase (Lake Major, Pockwock Lake). The construction of treatment works was only apparent at Lake Major and Pockwock Lake; other construction was not readily identified. At Lake Major, bulk geochemical parameter values returned to similar levels observed prior to the disturbance; at Pockwock Lake, parameter values changed rapidly following water level change, although this was coincident with mill operations ceasing on the lake. Changes in bulk geochemical parameter values were not consistent between Lake Major and Pockwock Lake at the point of water level change, suggesting that water level change has a lake-specific bulk geochemical signature in these systems.
Interpretation of geochemical parameters

As a whole, the bulk sedimentary geochemical parameters used in this study responded strongly to some watershed disturbances ( Fig. 3 ), primarily driven by changes in Ti, K, Rb, and Zr (Fig. S2). This suggests that erosion of clastic material is well resolved using elemental concentrations of these 4 elements, which has long been observed by paleolimnological investigators (Mackereth 1966 . . . Philos Trans R Soc London, Ser B. 250:–. doi:. , Engstrom and Wright 1984 , . . . In: , , , editors. Lake sediments and environmental history: studies in palaeolimnology and palaeoecology in honour of Winifred Tutin. : . p. –. , Boyle 2001 . . . In: , , editors. Tracking environmental change using lake sediments: Volume 2: Physical and geochemical methods. : . p. –. ). In general, concentrations of Ti, K, Rb, Zr, responded together and opposite to C concentrations, which suggests that either organic matter deposition decreased during periods of watershed disturbance, clastic input diluted organic matter, or both (Cohen 2003 . . Paleolimnology: the history and evolution of lake systems. : . ). It seems most likely that during periods of watershed disturbance, erosion of inorganic material increased and diluted organic matter input. The organic matter C/N ratio often changed coincident with watershed disturbance, but sometimes indicated that disturbance resulted in a more terrestrial C/N ratio (Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, and First Chain Lake), or a more autochthonous C/N ratio (First Lake and Lake Fletcher). The greatest changes in δ 15 N values occurred when C/N ratios decreased, although it is unclear whether this is a signature of increased anthropogenic nutrient input, increased contribution of autochthonous organic matter, or both.

Several parameters did not systematically respond to watershed-scale land-use change, including Ca and δ 13 C. These parameters were inconsistently aligned with both historical data ( Fig. 3 ) and alignment on PC1 (Fig. S2) between lakes. Lime addition was noted at First Chain Lake to control aquatic growth in the late 1800s and early 1900s, likely due to acid production from erosion of the bedrock exposed during construction of the railway (Johnston 1908 . . . Proc Trans N S Inst Sci. 12:–. ). This practice may have occurred on other lakes, complicating the interpretation of Ca concentrations. Ca (Davis and Norton 1978 , . . . Polskie Archiwum Hydrobiologii. 25:–. ) and δ 13 C (O'Reilly et al. 2005 , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 34:–. doi:. ) have both been previously noted as varying independent of watershed-scale change, suggesting that they may be representative of autochthonous or atmospheric processes in addition to watershed-scale changes such as carbon source (δ 13 C) or minerogenic input (Ca).
Comparison to bioindicator studies

Several previous paleolimnogical studies examined Pockwock Lake using diatoms (Tropea et al. 2007 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 23:–. doi:. ), scaled chrysophytes (Ginn et al. 2010 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 43:–. doi:. ), and a pre-/post-anthropogenic impact diatom approach (Ginn et al. 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ), although these studies had a limited ability to evaluate watershed-scale changes that may have influenced observed trends in species composition. Tropea et al. ( 2007 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 23:–. doi:. ) noted 2 distinct decreases (∼1940 and ∼1992) in diatom-inferred pH, neither of which were specifically identified in this study as times of abrupt change. Similarly, the times of abrupt change identified in this study were not identified by Tropea et al. ( 2007 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 23:–. doi:. ) or Ginn et al. ( 2010 , , , . . . J Paleolimnol. 43:–. doi:. ), although the T. flocculosa strain III profile from Tropea et al. ( 2007 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 23:–. doi:. ) appears to respond coincident with lithogenic elements reported in this study. Ginn et al. ( 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ) reported a decrease in diatom-inferred pH (DI-pH) and diatom-inferred log-specific conductance (DI-SC) from pre-anthropogenic samples to surficial samples, however, because multiple impacts occurred between pre-anthropogenic samples and the time the core was collected, it is uncertain which watershed-scale impact (if any) is responsible for these trends.

Similarly, Ginn et al. ( 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ) observed trends between pre-anthropogenic sediments and surficial sediments in other study lakes using DI-pH, DI-SC, and diatom-inferred total phosphorous (DI-TP). A slight decrease in DI-pH and DI-TP at First Chain/Second Chain lakes corresponds to widespread watershed disturbance, which is unique to First Chain/Second Chain lakes due to the high acid rock drainage potential of watershed geology (Tarr and White 2016 , . . . In: Geoscience and Mines Branch Report ME 2016-001: Report of Activities 2015. : . p. –. ). DI-TP increased at Lake Fletcher, likely because of widespread catchment urbanization as identified by this study. At Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, and First Lake, increases in DI-SC suggest road salt influence because of stormwater input (Ginn et al. 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ). Urbanization at these lakes was resolved in this study as increases in lithogenic element concentrations and δ 15 N values. This, in combination with the results of Ginn et al. ( 2015 , , , . . . Lake Reservoir Manage. 31:–. doi:. ), suggest that stormwater input may largely be responsible for these changes. In short, the data from this study were able to suggest causal mechanisms for the changes in water quality inferred by previous bioindicator studies.
Conclusions

Bulk sediment geochemistry from Lake Major, Pockwock Lake, Bennery Lake, Second Lake, Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, First Lake, and First Chain Lake reflect more than 2 centuries of anthropogenic disturbance in the HRM. These impacts include deforestation, urbanization, water works construction, and agriculture. Sediment records from these lakes were used to elucidate the sensitivity of bulk geochemical indicators to watershed-scale disturbances, and how these disturbances are recorded in the bulk geochemical record. Deforestation was resolved at Lake Major and Pockwock Lake by large increases in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb concentrations (50–300%) and moderate increases in C/N ratios (>10%). Urbanization was resolved at Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, and First Lake by increases in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb concentrations (10–300%), decreases in C/N ratios (>10%), and increases in δ 15 N values (>2.0‰). In some cases, these data were able to identify disturbances that were not previously identified by previous bioproxy studies. Collectively these data suggest that bulk geochemical parameters may be a useful method for lake managers to screen for previous disturbances that may be causing adverse water quality changes, and to help predict future water quality changes from as yet undetermined disturbances.

and 2016, and are courtesy of the Halifax Water lake sampling program. Water quality for First
Lake and Second Lake were obtained from Tymstra (2013) and Misiuk (2014), respectively. ND
is used when all samples from 2015 and 2016 were non-detect. The variable “z” denotes water
depth; SD denotes Secchi depth. Trophic state was calculated as the minimum and maximum
trophic state using the minimum and maximum of all available parameters, using criteria from
Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (2004) and Carlson and Simpson (1996).

First Lake Age-depth Model
Figure S1. Total elemental Pb concentrations for First Lake (FLK12-1) and Second Lake
(SLK13-1). The age-depth model for Second Lake is based on
210
Pb activity; the age-depth model
for First Lake is based on the point where total elemental Pb concentrations rise above
background matched to the core from Second Lake (~1895), the peak of the total elemental Pb
concentration matched to the core from Second Lake (~1958), and the time at which the core
was collected (2012).
